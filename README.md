Scala-HelloWorld
================

`Hello World` is the most minimal [Scala 3] project you can possibly imagine. It comes up bundled with the minimal set of dependencies required to build, test and run a standalone application JAR. It does not do anything besides printing out a `Hello World!` message to the console, and is meant to primarily serve as an empty template for a quick start to setup your own Scala application. Please adapt package and class names as well as build configuration files according to the needs of your program.

This `Hello World` application is setup with [sbt 1.7.1] as a build tool, [sbt-proguard 0.5.0] as an sbt [plugin] for running [ProGuard 7.2.2], [ScalaTest 3.2.13] as a unit-testing framework, [scopt 4.1.0] as a command line options parsing library, [Scala Logging 3.9.5] as a logging library wrapping [SLF4J], and [Logback 1.2.11] as a backend logging framework.
