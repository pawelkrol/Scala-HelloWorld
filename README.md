Scala-HelloWorld
================

`Hello World` is the most minimal [Scala 2.13](https://www.scala-lang.org/) project you can possibly imagine. It comes up bundled with the minimal set of dependencies required to build, test and run a standalone application JAR. It does not do anything besides printing out a `Hello World!` message to the console, and is meant to primarily serve as an empty template for a quick start to setup your own Scala application. Please adapt package and class names as well as build configuration files according to the needs of your program.

This `Hello World` application is setup with [sbt 1.3.13](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) as a build tool, [sbt-proguard 0.4.0](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-proguard) as an sbt [plugin](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Using-Plugins.html) for running [ProGuard 7.0.0](http://proguard.sourceforge.net/), [ScalaTest 3.2.2](http://www.scalatest.org/) as a unit-testing framework, [scopt 3.7.1](https://github.com/scopt/scopt) as a command line options parsing library, [Scala Logging 3.9.2](https://github.com/lightbend/scala-logging) as a logging library wrapping [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/), and [Logback 1.2.3](http://logback.qos.ch/) as a backend logging framework.
